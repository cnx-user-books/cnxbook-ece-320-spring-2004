\section{DSP Implementation}

Once a working \matlab simulation is completed, the DSP implementation 
of this exercise is relatively straight forward.  To test your
implementation you can use the function generator to generate
a BPSK waveform by setting it to a square wave of the correct 
frequency.  
You should send the on-time sample as well as the averaging filter output
to the D/A to verify that your system is working. 

\section{Extensions}

As your final project will require some modification to the discussed
BPSK signaling, you will want to refer to the listed references,
\cite{Proakis1, Blahut1}, and
consider some of the following questions regarding such modifications:

$\bullet$ How much noise is necessary to disrupt the symbol-timing?

$\bullet$ What happens when the input is random 
          (not simply $+1, -1, +1, -1, ...$)?

$\bullet$ What would the matched filter look like for different symbol shapes?
 
$\bullet$ What other methods of symbol timing are available for your 
          application?

$\bullet$ How does accumulating the early-late decisions help suppress the 
          effects of noise?
