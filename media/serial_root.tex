\section{Implementation}

Implementation of this lab should be done in two stages. First, use
the new \verb+core.asm+ file and the 6-channel board to reimplement
the variable-delay feedback echo that you wrote for Project Lab 1,
adding in additional test points to take advantage of the 6-channel
output. When this is complete, you will use the serial port on the DSP
EVM to implement a MATLAB GUI that allows the two system gains and the
echo delay to be changed using on-screen sliders. 

Don't forget to set the PMST register to 0xFFE0 before you load code
that has been built using the 6-channel core file.

\subsection{Feedback System Implementation}

\caption{Feedback System with Test Points}
\label{fig: system}
\end{figure}

First, implement the Figure \ref{fig: system} shown using the 
surround board and its \verb+core.asm+ file. Make
sure to use the \verb+READPROG+ and \verb+WRITPROG+ macros to access
the external program RAM instead of the \verb+reada+ and \verb+writa+
opcodes you used before.  You will use both channels of input by summing
the two inputs (so that either one, or both, may be used as an input to
the system). You will use the multichannel output by sending signals at
several test points to the 6-channel board's D/A converters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{The summed input signal}
  \item{The input signal after gain stage $G1$}
  \item{The data going into the long delay}
  \item{The data coming out of the delay}
\end{itemize}

Note that the data going into the long delay (D/A 3 in the Figure
\ref{fig: system}) is the output of the system you implemented in Project
Lab I.

As you implement this code, ensure that the delay $n$ and the gain
values $G_1$ and $G_2$ are stored in memory and can be easily changed
using the debugger. If you do this, it will be easier to extend your
code to accept its parameters from MATLAB in Part 2.

\subsection{MATLAB Interface Implementation}

Using the MATLAB interface outlined above as a base, write MATLAB code to send
commands to the serial interface based on three sliders: two gain sliders
(for $G_1$ and $G_2$) and one delay slider (for $n$). Then modify the code
you wrote reimplementing Project Lab I to accept those commands and change
the values for $G_1$, $G_2$ and $n$. Make sure that $n$ can be set to
values spanning the full range of 0 to 131,072, although it is not necessary
that every number in that range be represented.
