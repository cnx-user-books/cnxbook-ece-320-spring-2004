The TMS320C549 DSP includes accumulator-addressed program memory read
and write instructions: \verb+readprog+ and \verb+writprog+. These allow the
processor to read or write from data memory to an arbitrary location
in program memory. Data memory is addressed using a standard memory
reference; program memory is addressed using the contents of the
accumulator A.

For instance, the following code fragment loads the value contained
in memory location 023456h into the location 0064h in data memory
using the \verb+readprog+ opcode:

\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.4cm}
\listinginput{1}{readprog_example.asm}
\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5cm}

The \verb+writprog+ opcode can be used similary to write into extended program
RAM:

\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.4cm}
\listinginput{1}{writprog_example.asm}
\setlength{\baselineskip}{0.5cm}

Note that Code Composer will not show you or allow you to change the
contents of the extended program
RAM on the memory-dump or disassembly screen, though you can or change it
indirectly by watching the effects of the \verb+readprog+ and \verb+writprog+
opcodes in data memory.
