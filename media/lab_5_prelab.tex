\section{Prelab: Matlab Preparation}
We have made considerable use of \matlab in previous labs to
design filters and determine frequency responses of systems.
\matlab is also very useful as a simulation tool.

Use the following \matlab code skeleton to simulate your system
and fill in the incomplete portions.  Note that the code is not
complete and will not execute properly as written.  How does the
spectrum of the transmitted signal change with $T_{symb}$ ?
