      <title>Implementation</title> 
      
      <para id="p16"> On the DSP, you will implement the
	<term>elliptic low-pass filter</term> designed using the
	<code>ellip</code> command from <link document="m10623">IIR
	Filters: Filter-Design Exercise in MATLAB</link>. You should
	not try to implement the notch filter designed in <link document="m10813">IIR Filtering: Filter-Coefficient
	Quantization Exercise in MATLAB</link>, because it will not
	work correctly when implemented using Direct Form II.  (Why
	not?)
      </para>
      <para id="p17">
	To implement the fourth-order filter, start with a single set
	of second-order coefficients and implement a single
	second-order section.  Make sure you write and review
	pseudo-code <emphasis>before</emphasis> you begin programming.
	Once your single second-order IIR is working properly you can
	then proceed to code the entire fourth-order filter.

	<title>Large coefficients</title>
	<para id="p18">
	  You may have noticed that some of the coefficients you have
	  computed for the second-order sections are larger than 1.0
	  in magnitude.  For any stable second-order IIR section, the
	  magnitude of the "0" and "2" coefficients 
	  (<m:math>
	    <m:ci><m:msub>
		<m:mi>a</m:mi>
		<m:mn>0</m:mn>
	      </m:msub></m:ci>
	  </m:math> and 
	  <m:math>
	    <m:ci><m:msub>
		<m:mi>a</m:mi>
		<m:mn>2</m:mn>
	      </m:msub></m:ci>
	  </m:math>, for example) will always be less than or equal to
	  1.0.  However, the magnitude of the "1" coefficient can be
	  as large as 2.0.  To overcome this problem, you will have to
	  divide the
	  <m:math>
	    <m:ci><m:msub>
		<m:mi>a</m:mi>
		<m:mn>1</m:mn>
	      </m:msub></m:ci>
	  </m:math> and

	    <m:ci><m:msub>
		<m:mi>b</m:mi>
		<m:mn>1</m:mn>
	      </m:msub></m:ci>
	  </m:math> coefficients by two prior to saving them for your
	  DSP code.  Then, in your implementation, you will have to
	  compensate somehow for using half the coefficient value.

	<title>Repeating code</title>
	<para id="p20">
	  Rather than write separate code for each second-order
	  section, you are encouraged first to write one section, then
	  write code that cycles through the second-order section code
	  twice using the repeat structure below.  Because the IIR
	  code will have to run inside the block I/O loop and this
	  loop uses the <term>block repeat counter</term>
	  (<code>BRC</code>), you must use another looping structure
	  to avoid corrupting the <code>BRC</code>.  <note type="Note" id="idm6651536"><label>Note</label>You will have to make sure that your code uses
	  different coefficients and states during the second cycle of
	  the repeat loop.</note>

	<title>Gain</title>
	<para id="p21">
	  It may be necessary to add gain to the output of the system.
	  To do this, simply shift the output left (which can be done
	  using the <code>ld</code> opcode with its optional
	  <code>shift</code> parameter) before saving the output to
	  memory.
