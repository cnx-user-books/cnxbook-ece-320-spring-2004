        This exercise assumes you have access to a laboratory station
        equipped with a Texas Instruments TMS320C549 digital signal
        processor chip mounted on a Spectrum Digital TMS320LC54x
        evaluation board. The DSP evaluation module should be
        connected to a PC running Windows and will be controlled using
        the PC application Code Composer Studio, a debugger and
        development environment.  Mounted on top of each DSP
        evaluation board is a Spectrum Digital surround-sound module
        employing a Crystal Semiconductor CS4226 codec.  This board
        provides two analog input channels and six analog output
        channels at the CD sample rate of 44.1 kHz.  The DSP board can
        also communicate with user code or a terminal emulator running
        on the PC via a serial data interface.

      <para id="p2">
        In addition to the DSP board and PC, each laboratory station
        should also be equipped with a function generator to provide
        test signals and an oscilloscope to display the processed
        waveforms.

          channels 1 and 2 of the oscilloscope.  The input and output

          the output on channel 2 is the unfiltered input signal.
          This allows you to view the raw input and filtered output

        <para id="p9">
          Before you can execute and test the provided FIR filter
          code, you must assemble the source file.  First, bring up a
          <code>DOS</code> prompt window and create a new directory to
          hold the files, and then copy them into your directory:
        </para>

        </list>

	<para id="p10">
	  Next, assemble the filter code by typing <code>asm
	  filter</code> at the <code>DOS</code> prompt.  The
	  assembling process first includes the FIR filter
	  coefficients (stored in <code>coef.asm</code>) into the
	  assembly file <code>filter.asm</code>, then compiles the
	  result to produce an output file containing the executable
	  binary code, <code>filter.out</code>.

      <section id="sec2b">
	<title>Step 4: Verify filter execution</title>
	<para id="p11">
	  With your filter code assembled, double-click on the Code
	  Composer icon to open the debugging environment.  Before
	  loading your code, you must reset the DSP board and
	  initialize the <term>processor mode status register</term>
	  (<term>PMST</term>).  To reset the board, select the
	  <code>Reset</code> option from the <code>Debug</code> menu
	  in the Code Composer application.
	</para>
	<para id="p12">
	  Once the board is reset, select the <code>CPU
	  Registers</code> option from the <code>View</code> menu,
	  then select <code>CPU Register</code>.  This will open a
	  sub-window at the bottom of the Code Composer application
	  window that displays several of the DSP registers.  Look for
	  the <code>PMST</code> register; it must be set to the
	  hexadecimal value <code>FFE0</code> to have the DSP
	  evaluation board work correctly.  If it is not set
	  correctly, change the value of the <code>PMST</code>
	  register by double-clicking on the value and making the
	  appropriate change in the <code>Edit Register</code> window
	  that comes up.

	<para id="p13">
	  Now, load your assembled filter file onto the DSP by
	  selecting <code>Load Program</code> from the

	  execute the code by selecting <code>Run</code> from the
	  <code>Debug</code> menu.

	<para id="p14">
	  The program you are running accepts input from input channel
	  1 and sends output waveforms to output channels 1 and 2 (the
	  filtered signal and raw input, respectively).  Note that the
	  "raw input" on output channel 2 may differ from the actual
	  input on input channel 1, because of distortions introduced
	  in converting the analog input to a digital signal and then
	  back to an analog signal.  The A/D and D/A converters on the
	  six-channel surround board operate at a sample rate of 44.1
	  kHz and have an <term>anti-aliasing filter</term> and an
	  <term>anti-imaging filter</term>, respectively, that in the
	  ideal case would eliminate frequency content above 22.05
	  kHz.  The converters on the six-channel board are also
	  <term>AC coupled</term> and cannot pass DC signals.  On the
	  basis of this information, what differences do you expect to
	  see between the signals at input channel 1 and at output
	  channel 2?

	  Set the amplitude on the function generator to 1.0 V
	  peak-to-peak and the pulse shape to sinusoidal.  Observe the

	  relevant frequency range for a DSP system with a sample rate
	  of 44.1 kHz?

	<para id="p17">
	  Based on the frequency response you observe, characterize
	  the filter in terms of its type (e.g., low-pass, high-pass,
	  band-pass) and its -6 dB (half-amplitude) cutoff frequency
	  (or frequencies).  It may help to set the trigger on channel
	  2 of the oscilloscope since the signal on channel 1 may go
	  to zero.

	  Now, modify the file <code>filter.asm</code> to use the
	  alternative "test vector" core file, <link resource="vectcore.asm">vectcore.asm</link>.  Rather than
	  accepting input from the A/D converters and sending output
	  to the D/A, this core file takes its input from, and saves
	  its output to, memory on the DSP.  The test vector is stored
	  in a block of memory on the DSP evaluation board that will
	  not interfere with your program code or data.  <note id="id8464853" type="Note"><label>Note</label>The test vector is stored in the ".etext"

	  Introduction to Six-Channel Board for TI EVM320C54</link>
	  for more information on the DSP memory sections, including a
	  memory map.</note> The memory block that holds the test
	  vector is large enough to hold a vector up to 4,000 elements
	  long. The test vector stores data for both channels of input
	  and from all six channels of output.

	  To run your program with test vectors, you will need to
	  modify <code>filter.asm</code>.  The assembly source is
	  simply a text file and can be edited using the editor of
	  your preference, including WordPad, Emacs, and VI.  Replace
	  the first line of the file with two lines.  Instead of:

	  These changes will copy in the test vector you created and
	  use the alternative core file.  After modifying your code,
	  assemble it, then load and run the file using Code Composer
	  as before.  After a few seconds, halt the DSP (using the
	  <code>Halt</code> command under the <code>Debug</code> menu)
	  and verify that the DSP has halted at a branch statement
	  that branches to itself. In the disassembly window, the
	  following line should be highlighted: <code>0000:611F F073 B
	  611fh</code>.

	  Next, save the test output file and load it back into
	  MATLAB.  This can be done by first saving 3,000 memory
	  elements (six channels times 500 samples) starting with
	  location <code>0x8000</code> in program memory.  Do this by
	  choosing <code>File-&gt;Data-&gt;Save...</code> in Code Composer
	  Studio, then entering the filename <code>output.dat</code>
	  and pressing <code>Enter</code>.  Next, enter
	  <code>0x8000</code> in the Address field of the dialog box
	  that pops up, <code>3000</code> in the Length field, and
	  choose <code>Program</code> from the drop-down menu next to
	  <code>Page</code>. Always make sure that you use the correct
	  length (six times the length of the test vector) when you
	  save your results.

	<para id="p42">
	  Last, use the <code>read_vector</code> (available as <link resource="read_vector.m">read_vector.m</link>) function to read
	  the saved result into MATLAB. Do this using the following
	  MATLAB command:
	</para>
	<code id="id1165433279397" display="block">
	  
	  &gt;&gt; [ch1, ch2] = read_vector('output.dat');
	  
	</code>
	<para id="p43">
	  Now, the MATLAB vector <code>ch1</code> corresponds to the
	  filtered version of the test signal you generated. The
	  MATLAB vector <code>ch2</code> should be nearly identical to
	  the test vector you generated, as it was passed from the DSP
	  system's input to its output unchanged.  <note id="id8531181" type="Note"><label>Note</label>Because of quantization error introduced in
	  saving the test vector for the 16-bit memory of the DSP, the
	  vector <code>ch2</code> will not be identical to the MATLAB
	  generated test vector.  Furthermore, a bug in our test vector environment sometimes causes blocks of samples to be dropped, so the test vector output signal may have gaps.</note>

	<para id="p44">
	  After loading the output of the filter into MATLAB, compare
	  the expected output (calculated as <code>out</code> above)
	  and the output of the filter (in <code>ch1</code> from
	  above). This can be done graphically by simply plotting the
	  two curves on the same axes; for example:
	</para>
	<code id="id5174166" display="block">
	  
	  &gt;&gt; plot(out,'r'); % Plot the expected curve in red 
	  &gt;&gt; hold on        % Plot the next plot on top of this one 
	  &gt;&gt; plot(ch1,'g'); % Plot the expected curve in green 
	  &gt;&gt; hold off 
	  
	</code>
	<para id="p47">
	  You should also ensure that the difference between the two
	  outputs is near zero. This can be done by plotting the
	  difference between the two vectors:
	</para>
	<code id="id3797337" display="block">
	  
	  &gt;&gt; plot(out(1:length(ch1))-ch1); % Plot error signal 
	  
	</code>
	<para id="p48">
	  You will observe that the two sequences are not exactly the
	  same; this is due to the fact that the DSP computes its
	  response to 16 bits precision, while MATLAB uses 64-bit
	  floating point numbers for its arithmetic.  Blocks of output samples may also be missing from the test vector output due to a bug in the test vector core.  Nonetheless, the test vector environment allows one to run repeatable experiments using the same known test input for debugging.
